## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Apify Hosted Server (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our **hosted MCP server on Apify** - no installation required!

**Free Tier Available**: Basic features are free. [Get started →](https://apify.com/adrian_m/jakartamigrationmcp)

**MCP Server URL**: `https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP`

**Configuration** (works with all MCP clients that support SSE):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jakarta-migration": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP"
    }
  }
}
```

> **🔑 Authentication**: You'll need an Apify API token. Get it from [Apify Console → Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations). Some MCP clients may prompt you to authenticate via OAuth.

See [Apify Setup](#apify-hosted-server-setup) below for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Run Locally (STDIO)

For local development or when you need full control:

**Prerequisites**: Java 21+ and Node.js 18+

```bash
# Install via npm (one-time)
npm install -g @jakarta-migration/mcp-server

# Or use with npx (no installation)
npx -y @jakarta-migration/mcp-server
```

See [Local Setup](#local-setup-stdio) below for client configuration.

## 📋 What It Does

The Jakarta Migration MCP Server enables your AI coding assistant to:

- **🔍 Analyze Jakarta Readiness** - Assess Java projects for migration readiness with detailed dependency analysis
- **🚫 Detect Blockers** - Identify dependencies and code patterns that prevent Jakarta migration
- **📦 Recommend Versions** - Suggest Jakarta-compatible versions for existing dependencies
- **📋 Create Migration Plans** - Generate comprehensive, phased migration plans with risk assessment
- **📊 Analyze Migration Impact** - Comprehensive impact analysis combining dependency analysis and source code scanning
- **✅ Verify Runtime** - Test migrated applications to ensure they run correctly after migration

### The Problem It Solves

Migrating from Java EE 8 (`javax.*`) to Jakarta EE 9+ (`jakarta.*`) is complex because:

- **Dependency Hell**: Many libraries haven't migrated, creating transitive conflicts
- **Binary Incompatibility**: Compiled JARs may reference `javax.*` internally
- **Hidden Dependencies**: `javax.*` usage in XML configs, annotations, and dynamic loading
- **Risk Assessment**: Need to understand migration impact before starting

This MCP server provides AI assistants with the specialized knowledge and tools to navigate these challenges effectively.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Your code and project data are handled with the utmost care. We understand that Java developers working with enterprise codebases need complete confidence in the security and privacy of their intellectual property.

### Stateless Architecture

✅ **No Data Persistence** - The service is completely stateless. Your project files, source code, and analysis results are never stored, logged, or persisted on our servers.

✅ **No Data Collection** - We don't collect, track, or analyze your code. Each request is processed independently with no memory of previous requests.

✅ **Local Execution Option** - For maximum privacy, you can run the entire service locally using the [Local Setup](#local-setup-stdio) option. Your code never leaves your machine.

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Zero Code Storage**: Project files are only read during analysis and immediately discarded
- **No Telemetry**: No usage tracking, analytics, or code scanning for any purpose other than migration analysis
- **Open Source**: The core service is open source, so you can audit exactly what it does
- **Enterprise Ready**: Safe for use with proprietary and sensitive codebases

### Hosted Service (Apify)

When using the Apify-hosted service:
- Analysis is performed in isolated, ephemeral containers
- All containers are destroyed immediately after processing
- No persistent storage is used
- Your API token is only used for authentication and billing

### Local Service

When running locally via STDIO:
- **100% Local** - Everything runs on your machine
- **No Network Calls** - No external requests are made
- **Complete Control** - You have full visibility and control over the process

**For maximum security and privacy, we recommend using the local STDIO setup for sensitive projects.**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Apify Hosted Server Setup

The Apify-hosted server works with **all MCP clients** that support SSE transport.

**MCP Server URL**: `https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP`  
**Actor Page**: [apify.com/adrian_m/jakartamigrationmcp](https://apify.com/adrian_m/jakartamigrationmcp)

> **🔑 Authentication Required**: You'll need an Apify API token. Get it from [Apify Console → Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations). Some MCP clients support OAuth authentication which will prompt you to sign in.

#### For Cursor IDE

> **⚠️ Important**: Cursor primarily supports **stdio transport**, not SSE. For Cursor, use the [Local Setup (STDIO)](#local-setup-stdio) instructions below instead.

If your Cursor version supports SSE:
1. Open Cursor Settings (`Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+,` on Mac)
2. Navigate to **Features** → **MCP**
3. Click **"+ Add New MCP Server"**
4. Add configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jakarta-migration": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **🔑 Get API Token**: Replace `YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN` with your token from [Apify Console → Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations)

5. **Restart Cursor** completely for changes to take effect

#### For Claude Code (VS Code Extension)

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "MCP" or navigate to **Extensions** → **Claude Code** → **Settings**
3. Add configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jakarta-migration": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **🔑 Get API Token**: Replace `YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN` with your token from [Apify Console → Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations)

4. Restart VS Code

#### For GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot supports MCP through the Copilot Chat interface:

   - **URL**: `https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP`
   - **Transport Type**: **SSE**
   - **Authorization**: Add your Apify API token in the headers section

> **🔑 Get API Token**: Get your token from [Apify Console → Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations)

#### For Antigravity

1. Open Antigravity Settings
2. Navigate to **MCP Configuration**
3. Add server:

```json
{
  "name": "jakarta-migration",
  "type": "sse",
  "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,adrian_m/JakartaMigrationMCP",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

> **🔑 Get API Token**: Replace `YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN` with your token from [Apify Console → Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Appearing

1. **Restart your IDE completely** - MCP servers load on startup
2. **Check MCP server status** - Look for errors in IDE logs
3. **Verify configuration** - Ensure JSON syntax is correct
4. **Check prerequisites** - Java 21+ and Node.js 18+ must be installed

### Connection Issues

**For Apify (SSE):**
- Verify your internet connection
- Check if Apify service is available
- Ensure you're using the correct URL

**For Local (STDIO):**
- Verify Java is installed: `java -version`
- Verify Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Try running manually: `npx -y @jakarta-migration/mcp-server`

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Windows:**
- Use forward slashes in paths: `C:/path/to/file.jar`
- Ensure Java is in your PATH

**Mac/Linux:**
- Ensure execute permissions: `chmod +x gradlew`
- Use absolute paths in configuration
